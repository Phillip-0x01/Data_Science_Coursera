<h3>Tufte's data visualization principles</h3>

<p>(Edward Tufte (2006). Beautiful Evidence, Graphics Press LLC. [www.edwardtufte.com])</p>

<p><strong>Principle 1:</strong> Show comparison 
* Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis.
* Always ask "Compared to What?"</p>

<p><strong>Principle 2:</strong> Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
* What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?</p>

<p><strong>Principle 3:</strong> Show multivariate data
* Multivariate = more than 2 variables
* The real world is multivariate
* Need to "escape flatland"</p>

<p>Important to show as many variables as is reasonable at a given time so you can get a clear picture of the relationships in your data</p>

<p><strong>Principle 4:</strong> Integration of evidence
* Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
* Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
* Don't let the tool drive the analysis</p>

<p><strong>Principle 5:</strong> Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
* A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible</p>

<p>Preserve computer code used to make the plot!</p>

<p><strong>Principle 6:</strong> Content is king
* Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content</p>

<h2>Exploratory Graph's</h2>

<hr />

<h4>Characteristics of exploratory graphs</h4>

<ul>
<li>They are made quickly</li>
<li>A large number are made</li>
<li>The goal is for personal understanding</li>
<li>Axes/legends are generally cleaned up (later)</li>
<li>Color/size are primarily used for information</li>
</ul>

<p>Question: Are there any counties in the U.S. that exceed that national standard for 
fine particle pollution?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pollution &lt;- read.csv("data/avgpm25.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", 
    "factor", "numeric", "numeric"))
head(pollution)</p>

<h2>pm25  fips region longitude latitude</h2>
</blockquote>

<h2>1  9.771 01003   east    -87.75    30.59</h2>

<h2>2  9.994 01027   east    -85.84    33.27</h2>

<h2>3 10.689 01033   east    -87.73    34.73</h2>

<h2>4 11.337 01049   east    -85.80    34.46</h2>

<h2>5 12.120 01055   east    -86.03    34.02</h2>

<h2>6 10.828 01069   east    -85.35    31.19</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do any counties exceed the standard of 12 μg/m3?</p>

<h4>Simply Summary of Data</h4>

<ul>
<li>One dimension
<ul>
<li>Five-number summary</li>
<li>Boxplots</li>
<li>Histograms</li>
<li>Density plot</li>
<li>Barplot</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Five-number summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>summary(pollution$pm25)</p>

<h2>Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.</h2>
</blockquote>

<h2>3.38    8.55   10.00    9.84   11.40   18.40</h2>

<p>Abline gives you a horizontal line across the of the box to show median</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>boxplot(pollution$pm25, col = "blue")
abline(h = 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can adjust histogram using breaks, rug, and abline
Rug lists all of the data points under the x-axis to idenitfy where it bunches up</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>hist(pollution$pm25, col = "green", breaks = 100)
rug(pollution$pm25)
abline(v = median(pollution$pm25), col = "magenta", lwd = 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple bar plot of the data</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>barplot(table(pollution$region), col = "wheat", main = "Number of Counties in Each Region")</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Two dimension
<ul>
<li>Multiple/overlayed 1-D plots (Lattice/ggplot2)</li>
<li>Scatterplots</li>
<li>Smooth scatterplots</li>
<li>Overlayed/multiple 2-D plots; coplots</li>
<li>Use color, size, shape to add dimensions</li>
<li>Spinning plots</li>
<li>Actual 3-D plots (not that useful)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple boxplots</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>boxplot(pm25 ~ region, data = pollution, col = "red")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multiple histograms</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1))
hist(subset(pollution, region == "east")$pm25, col = "green")
hist(subset(pollution, region == "west")$pm25, col = "green")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scatterplot - abline adds the average</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25, col = region))
abline(h = 12, lwd = 2, lty = 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multiple Scatterplots</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1))
with(subset(pollution, region == "west"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "West"))
with(subset(pollution, region == "east"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "East"))</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Plotting Systems In R</h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Base Plotting System</strong>
* "Artist's palette" model
* Start with blank canvas and build up from there
* Start with plot function (or similar)
* Use annotation functions to add/modify (text, lines, points, axis)
* Convenient, mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
* Can’t go back once plot has started (i.e. to adjust margins); need to plan in advance
* Difficult to "translate" to others once a new plot has been created (no graphical "language")
* Plot is just a series of R commands</p>

<p>Example of a base plot</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Lattice System</strong>
* Plots are created with a single function call (xyplot, bwplot, etc.)
* Most useful for conditioning types of plots: Looking at how y changes with x across levels of z
* Things like margins/spacing set automatically because entire plot is specified at once
* Good for puttng many many plots on a screen
* Sometimes awkward to specify an entire plot in a single function call
* Annotation in plot is not especially intuitive
* Use of panel functions and subscripts difficult to wield and requires intense preparation
* Cannot "add" to the plot once it is created</p>

<p>Example of lattice plot</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(lattice)
state &lt;- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4, 1))</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The ggplot2 System</strong>
* Splits the difference between base and lattice in a number of ways
* Automatically deals with spacings, text, titles but also allows you to annotate by "adding" to a plot
* Superficial similarity to lattice but generally easier/more intuitive to use
* Default mode makes many choices for you (but you can still customize to your heart's desire)</p>

<p>Example ggplot2 scatterplot</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Base Plotting System in R</h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Process of Making a Plot</strong></p>

<p>When making a plot one must first make a few considerations (not necessarily in this order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Where will the plot be made? On the screen? In a file?</li>
<li>How will the plot be used?
<ul>
<li>Is the plot for viewing temporarily on the screen?</li>
<li>Will it be presented in a web browser?</li>
<li>Will it eventually end up in a paper that might be printed?</li>
<li>Are you using it in a presentation?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is there a large amount of data going into the plot? Or is it just a few points?</li>
<li>Do you need to be able to dynamically resize the graphic?</li>
<li>What graphics system will you use: base, lattice, or ggplot2? These generally cannot be mixed.</li>
<li>Base graphics are usually constructed piecemeal, with each aspect of the plot handled separately through a series of function calls; this is often conceptually simpler and allows plotting to mirror the thought process</li>
<li>Lattice graphics are usually created in a single function call, so all of the graphics parameters have to specified at once; specifying everything at once allows R to automatically calculate the necessary spacings and font sizes.</li>
<li>ggplot2 combines concepts from both base and lattice graphics but uses an independent implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>We focus on using the base plotting system to create graphics on the screen device.</p>

<p>Base graphics are used most commonly and are a very powerful system for creating 2-D graphics.
* There are two phases to creating a base plot
    + Initializing a new plot
    + Annotating (adding to) an existing plot
* Calling plot(x, y) or hist(x) will launch a graphics device (if one is not already open) and draw a new plot on the device
* If the arguments to plot are not of some special class, then the default method for plot is called; this function has many arguments, letting you set the title, x axis label, y axis label, etc.
* The base graphics system has many parameters that can set and tweaked; these parameters are documented in ?par; it wouldn’t hurt to try to memorize this help page!</p>

<p>Histogram example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(datasets)
hist(airquality$Ozone)  ## Draw a new plot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scatterplot example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(datasets)
with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boxplot example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(datasets)
airquality &lt;- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone (ppb)")</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Some Important Base Graphics Parameters</strong></p>

<p>Many base plotting functions share a set of parameters. Here are a few key ones:
* <strong>pch:</strong> the plotting symbol (default is open circle)
* <strong>lty:</strong> the line type (default is solid line), can be dashed, dotted, etc.
* <strong>lwd:</strong> the line width, specified as an integer multiple
* <strong>col:</strong> the plotting color, specified as a number, string, or hex code; the colors() function gives you a vector of colors by name
* <strong>xlab:</strong> character string for the x-axis label
* <strong>ylab:</strong> character string for the y-axis label</p>

<p>The par() function is used to specify global graphics parameters that affect all plots in an R session. These parameters can be overridden when specified as arguments to specific plotting functions.
* <strong>las:</strong> the orientation of the axis labels on the plot
* <strong>bg:</strong> the background color
* <strong>mar:</strong> the margin size
* <strong>oma:</strong> the outer margin size (default is 0 for all sides)
* <strong>mfrow:</strong> number of plots per row, column (plots are filled row-wise)
* <strong>mfcol:</strong> number of plots per row, column (plots are filled column-wise)</p>

<p>Some key base plotting functions
* plot: make a scatterplot, or other type of plot depending on the class of the object being plotted
* lines: add lines to a plot, given a vector x values and a corresponding vector of y values (or a 2-column matrix); this function just connects the dots
* points: add points to a plot
* text: add text labels to a plot using specified x, y coordinates
* title: add annotations to x, y axis labels, title, subtitle, outer margin
* mtext: add arbitrary text to the margins (inner or outer) of the plot
* axis: adding axis ticks/labels</p>

<p>Base plot with annotation</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(datasets)
with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))
title(main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City")  ## Add a title</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now subset the plot with different colors for the month of May(5)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City"))
with(subset(airquality, Month == 5), points(Wind, Ozone, col = "blue"))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Type = "n" below, creates an empty chart and then it goes through and builds the plot</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City", 
    type = "n"))
with(subset(airquality, Month == 5), points(Wind, Ozone, col = "blue"))
with(subset(airquality, Month != 5), points(Wind, Ozone, col = "red"))
legend("topright", pch = 1, col = c("blue", "red"), legend = c("May", "Other Months"))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regression line added to scatter plot</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City", 
    pch = 20))
model &lt;- lm(Ozone ~ Wind, airquality)
abline(model, lwd = 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multiple base plots</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
with(airquality, {
    plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind")
    plot(Solar.R, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Solar Radiation")
})</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you want a title across a panel of plots.  OMA (outer margin) is used to create the space, and then mtext is used to add the title name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>par(mfrow = c(1, 3), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))
with(airquality, {
    plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind")
    plot(Solar.R, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Solar Radiation")
    plot(Temp, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Temperature")
    mtext("Ozone and Weather in New York City", outer = TRUE)
})</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multiple Base Plots</p>

<p>par(mfrow = c(1, 3), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))
with(airquality, {
    plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind")
    plot(Solar.R, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Solar Radiation")
    plot(Temp, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Temperature")
    mtext("Ozone and Weather in New York City", outer = TRUE)
})</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Plots in the base plotting system are created by calling successive R functions to "build up" a plot</li>
<li>Plotting occurs in two stages:
<ul>
<li>Creation of a plot</li>
<li>Annotation of a plot (adding lines, points, text, legends)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The base plotting system is very flexible and offers a high degree of control over plotting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Base Plotting Notes</h2>

<hr />

<p>Use 'par' before you plot the data
Add labels, title, ledge after you plot the data
mfrow = multi-frame row(?), use it to make trellas plots
This will return two plots side by side:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>par(mfrow = c(1,2)) 
plot(x, y)
plot(x, z)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When adding multiple plots you'll most likely want to change the margins, use 'mar' for that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>par(mar = c(5, 4, 2, 2)) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>4, 4, 2, 2, above is the default size.  Goes bottom, left, top, right
'mfrow' will plot across rows first, 'mfcol' will plot down cols first (if you have a matrix of plots)</p>

<h3>Plotting Using Two Colors</h3>

<hr />

<p>Create a blank plot first, then add the data points</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>x &lt;- rnorm(100)
y &lt;- x + rnorm(100)
g &lt;- gl(2, 50)
g &lt;- gl(2, 50, labels = c("Male", "Female")
plot(x, y, type = "n")  #---  this creates the plot but does NOT load the data, you load it separately 
points(x[g == "Male"], y[g == "Male"], col = "green")
points(x[g == "Female"], y[g == "Female"], col = "blue")</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Graphic Devices in R</h2>

<hr />

<p>What is a Graphics Device?
* A graphics device is something where you can make a plot appear
  + A window on your computer (screen device)
  + A PDF file (file device)
  + A PNG or JPEG file (file device)
  + A scalable vector graphics (SVG) file (file device)</p>

<p>When you make a plot in R, it has to be "sent" to a specific graphics device
* The most common place for a plot to be "sent" is the screen device
  + On a Mac the screen device is launched with the quartz()
  + On Windows the screen device is launched with windows()
  + On Unix/Linux the screen device is launched with x11()</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When making a plot, you need to consider how the plot will be used to determine what device the plot should be sent to.</p>

<ul>
<li>The list of devices is found in ?Devices; there are also devices created by users on CRAN</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For quick visualizations and exploratory analysis, usually you want to use the screen device</p>

<ul>
<li>Functions like plot in base, xyplot in lattice, or qplot in ggplot2 will default to sending a plot to the screen device</li>
<li>On a given platform (Mac, Windows, Unix/Linux) there is only one screen device</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For plots that may be printed out or be incorporated into a document (e.g. papers/reports, slide presentations), usually a file device is more appropriate</p>

<ul>
<li>There are many different file devices to choose from</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>NOTE: Not all graphics devices are available on all platforms (i.e. you cannot launch the windows() on a Mac)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>How Does a Plot Get Created?
* The second approach to plotting is most commonly used for file devices:
  + Explicitly launch a graphics device
  + Call a plotting function to make a plot (Note: if you are using a file device, no plot will appear on the screen)
  + Annotate plot if necessary
  + Explicitly close graphics device with dev.off() (this is very important!)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pdf(file = "myplot.pdf")  ## Open PDF device; create 'myplot.pdf' in my working directory</p>

<h2>Create plot and send to a file (no plot appears on screen)</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")  ## Annotate plot; still nothing on screen
dev.off()  ## Close the PDF file device</p>

<h2>Now you can view the file 'myplot.pdf' on your computer</h2>

title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")  ## Annotate plot; still nothing on screen
dev.off()  ## Close the PDF file device</p>

<h2>Now you can view the file 'myplot.pdf' on your computer</h2>

<h3>Graphics File Devices</h3>

<hr />

<p>There are two basic types of file devices: vector and bitmap devices</p>

<p><strong>Vector formats:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>pdf: useful for line-type graphics, resizes well, usually portable, not efficient if a plot has many objects/points</li>
<li>svg: XML-based scalable vector graphics; supports animation and interactivity, potentially useful for web-based plots</li>
<li>win.metafile: Windows metafile format (only on Windows)</li>
<li>postscript: older format, also resizes well, usually portable, can be used to create encapsulated postscript files; Windows systems often don’t have a postscript viewer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bitmap formats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>png: bitmapped format, good for line drawings or images with solid colors, uses lossless compression (like the old GIF format), most web browsers can read this format natively, good for plotting many many many points, does not resize well</li>
<li>jpeg: good for photographs or natural scenes, uses lossy compression, good for plotting many many many points, does not resize well, can be read by almost any computer and any web browser, not great for line drawings</li>
<li>tiff: Creates bitmap files in the TIFF format; supports lossless compression</li>
<li>bmp: a native Windows bitmapped format</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Multiple Open Graphics Devices</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It is possible to open multiple graphics devices (screen, file, or both), for example when viewing multiple plots at once</li>
<li>Plotting can only occur on one graphics device at a time</li>
<li>The currently active graphics device can be found by calling dev.cur()</li>
<li>Every open graphics device is assigned an integer ≥2.</li>
<li>You can change the active graphics device with dev.set(<integer>) where <integer> is the number associated with the graphics device you want to switch to</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Copying Plots</strong>
Copying a plot to another device can be useful because some plots require a lot of code and it can be a pain to type all that in again for a different device.</p>

<ul>
<li>dev.copy: copy a plot from one device to another</li>
<li>dev.copy2pdf: specifically copy a plot to a PDF file</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: Copying a plot is not an exact operation, so the result may not be identical to the original.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(datasets)
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))  ## Create plot on screen device
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")  ## Add a main title
dev.copy(png, file = "geyserplot.png")  ## Copy my plot to a PNG file
dev.off()  ## Don't forget to close the PNG device!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Plots must be created on a graphics device</li>
<li>The default graphics device is almost always the screen device, which is most useful for exploratory analysis</li>
<li>File devices are useful for creating plots that can be included in other documents or sent to other people</li>
<li>For file devices, there are vector and bitmap formats
<ul>
<li>Vector formats are good for line drawings and plots with solid colors using a modest number of points</li>
<li>Bitmap formats are good for plots with a large number of points, natural scenes or web-based plots</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Lattice Plotting System</h2>

<hr />

<p>Very useful for looking at a lot of data in a very quick way</p>

<p><strong>The lattice plotting system is implemented using the following packages:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>lattice: contains code for producing Trellis graphics, which are independent of the “base” graphics system; includes functions like xyplot, bwplot, levelplot</li>
<li>grid: implements a different graphing system independent of the “base” system; the lattice package builds on top of grid</li>
<li>We seldom call functions from the grid package directly</li>
<li>The lattice plotting system does not have a "two-phase" aspect with separate plotting and annotation like in base plotting</li>
<li>All plotting/annotation is done at once with a single function call</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lattice Functions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>xyplot: this is the main function for creating scatterplots</li>
<li>bwplot: box-and-whiskers plots (“boxplots”)</li>
<li>histogram: histograms</li>
<li>stripplot: like a boxplot but with actual points</li>
<li>dotplot: plot dots on "violin strings"</li>
<li>splom: scatterplot matrix; like pairs in base plotting system</li>
<li>levelplot, contourplot: for plotting "image" data</li>
</ul>

<p>Lattice functions generally take a formula for their first argument, usually of the form</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>xyplot(y ~ x | f * g, data)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>We use the formula notation here, hence the ~.</li>
<li>On the left of the ~ is the y-axis variable, on the right is the x-axis variable</li>
<li>f and g are conditioning variables — they are optional
<ul>
<li>the * indicates an interaction between two variables</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The second argument is the data frame or list from which the variables in the formula should be looked up
<ul>
<li>If no data frame or list is passed, then the parent frame is used.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If no other arguments are passed, there are defaults that can be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Simple Lattice Plot</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(lattice)
library(datasets)</p>

<h2>Simple scatterplot</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(datasets)
library(lattice)</p>

<h2>Convert 'Month' to a factor variable</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>airquality &lt;- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | Month, data = airquality, layout = c(5, 1))</p>

<p><strong>Lattice Behavior</strong></p>

<p>Lattice functions behave differently from base graphics functions in one critical way.</p>

<ul>
<li>Base graphics functions plot data directly to the graphics device (screen, PDF file, etc.)</li>
<li>Lattice graphics functions return an object of class <strong>trellis</strong></li>
<li>The print methods for lattice functions actually do the work of plotting the data on the graphics device.</li>
<li>Lattice functions return "plot objects" that can, in principle, be stored (but it’s usually better to just save the code + data).</li>
<li>On the command line, trellis objects are auto-printed so that it appears the function is plotting the data
<ul>
<li>No need to assign the plot to a letter and then print the letter, just use the built-in auto plotting function </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lattice Panel Functions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lattice functions have a <strong>panel function</strong> which controls what happens inside each panel of the plot.</li>
<li>The lattice package comes with default panel functions, but you can supply your own if you want to customize what happens in each panel</li>
<li>Panel functions receive the x/y coordinates of the data points in their panel (along with any optional arguments)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example - generate some random data
set.seed(10)
x &lt;- rnorm(100)
f &lt;- rep(0:1, each = 50)
y &lt;- x + f - f * x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)
f &lt;- factor(f, labels = c("Group 1", "Group 2"))
xyplot(y ~ x | f, layout = c(2, 1))  ## Plot with 2 panels</p>

<p>Custom panel function (to add a horizontal line)

    panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)  ## First call the default panel function for 'xyplot'
    panel.abline(h = median(y), lty = 2)  ## Add a horizontal line at the median
})</p>

<h3>Regression Line</h3>

<p>Custom panel function</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>xyplot(y ~ x | f, panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)  ## First call default panel function
    panel.lmline(x, y, col = 2)  ## Overlay a simple linear regression line
})</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lattice plots are constructed with a single function call to a core lattice function (e.g. xyplot)</li>
<li>Aspects like margins and spacing are automatically handled and defaults are usually sufficient</li>
<li>The lattice system is ideal for creating conditioning plots where you examine the same kind of plot under many different conditions</li>
<li>Panel functions can be specified/customized to modify what is plotted in each of the plot panels</li>
</ul>

<h2>ggplot2</h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Basics: qplot()</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Works much like the plot function in base graphics system</li>
<li>Looks for data in a data frame, similar to lattice, or in the parent environment </li>
<li>Plots are made up of <em>aesthetics</em> (size, shape, color) and <em>geoms</em> (points, lines)</li>
<li>Factors are important for indicating subsets of the data (if they are to have different properties); they should be <strong>labeled</strong></li>
<li>The qplot() hides hat goes on underneath, which is okay for most operations</li>
<li>ggplot() is the core function and very flexible for doing things qplot() cannot do</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(ggplot2)
qplot(x cord, y cord, data = df)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(ggplot2)
qplot(x cord, y cord, data = df, color = z) # z is another variable in the dataset where the data will be color based on that variable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Add a smoother</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>library(ggplot2)
qplot(x cord, y cord, data = df, geom = c("point", "smooth")</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Histogram</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>qplot(x, data = df, fill = z)  # similar to a stacked bar chart with the color fill</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Facets</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Similar to panels in lattice</li>
<li>Has 2 variables seperated by a tilda (~), the variable on the left = columns, variable on right = rows</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>qplot(x, y, data = df, facets = .~z) #or
qplot(x, y, facets = z~., binwidth = 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Density Smooth Plot</strong></p>

<p>Think of a bar chart without the bars but instead a line that outlines the peaks</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>qplot(x, data = df, geom = "density", color = z)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Scatter Plots with Smooth</strong>
Using 2 colors to identify data variables</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>qplot(x, y, data = df, color = z, geom = c("point", "smooth"), method = "lm")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Splitting plots into 2 facets (instead of colors)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>qplot(x, y, data = df, geom = c("point", "smooth"), method = "lm", facets = .~z)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>**Summary of qplot()</p>

<ul>
<li>The qplot() function is the analog to plot() but with many built-in features</li>
<li>Syntax somewhere in between base/lattice</li>
<li>Produces very nice graphics, essentially publication ready (if you like the design)</li>
<li>Difficult to go against the grain/customize (don't bother, use full ggplot2 power in that case)</li>
</ul>

<h2>ggplot 2 - Deeper Dive</h2>

<p>Basic components of a ggplot2 plot </p>

<ul>
<li>A data frame </li>
<li>aesthetic mappings: how data are mapped to color, size</li>
<li>geoms: geometric objects like points, lines, shapes</li>
<li>facets: for conditional plots</li>
<li>stats: statistical transformations like binning, quantiles, smoothing</li>
<li>scales: what scale an aesthetic map uses (ex. male = red, female = blue)</li>
<li>coordinate system</li>
</ul>

<p>When building plots in ggplot2 (rather than using qplot) the "artist's palette" model may be the closest analogy</p>

<p>Plots are built up in layers</p>

<ul>
<li>Plot the data</li>
<li>Overlay a summary </li>
<li>Metadata and annotation</li>
</ul>

<p>example </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g &lt;- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))
print(g)
ERROR: No layers in plot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Explicitly save and print ggplot object</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>p &lt;- g + geom_point()
print(p)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Auto-printing object with out saving</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_point()       </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Adding More Layers: Smooth</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_ point() + geom_smooth()</p>

<p>g + geom_ point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Adding More Layers: Facets</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_ point() + facet<em>grid(. ~ bmicat) + geom</em>smooth(method="lm")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In ggplot its much better to fix all of data labels first in the data frame/table BEFORE plotting!!!</p>

<p><strong>Anotation</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Labels: xlab(), ylab(), labs(), ggtitle()</li>
<li>Each of the "geom" functions has options to modify</li>
<li>For things that only make sense globally, use theme() #globally meaning the 'whole plot'
<ul>
<li>Example: theme(legend.position = "none) </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two standard appearance themes are included
<ul>
<li>theme_ gray(): The default theme (gray background)</li>
<li>theme_ bw(): More start/plain</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Modifying Aesthetics</strong></p>

<p>Here we are simply giving the points a color</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_points(color = "steelblue", size = 4, alpha = 1/2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we are assigning the color to an aesthetic as a variable </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_points(aes(color = VARIABLE), size = 4, alpha = 1/2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Customize the smooth</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_ points(aes(color = VARIABLE), size = 4, alpha = 1/2) +
    geom_smooth(size = 4, linetype = 3, method = "lm", se = FALSE)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Change the overall theme</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_points(aes(color = VARIABLE)) + theme _bw(base _family = "Times")</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Axis Limits</strong></p>

<p>If there is an outlier in the data frame (say 100), the code below will NOT show the outlier</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_line() + ylim(-3,3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to include the outlier you need use the following code</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_ line() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-3,3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example</p>

<p>Caculate the deciles of the data </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cutpoints &lt;- quantile(maccs$lonno2_new, seq(0, 1, length =4), na.rm = TRUE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cut the data at the deciles and create a new factor variable 
    Note: the cut function breaks the data into categorical variables for plotting based on the buckets you create</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>maacs$no2dec &lt;- cut(maacs$logno2_new, cutpoints)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the levels of the newly created factor variable</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>levels(maacs$no2dec)
[1] "(0.378,1.2)" "(1.2,1.42)" "(1.42,2.55)"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example of a large 4x2 trellius plot with numerous layers </p>

<p><em>Setup ggplot with data frame</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g &lt;- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Add layers (steps below are: add points, make panels, add smoother, change theme, add labels)</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g + geom_point(alpha = 1/3)  #makes the points transparent
  '+' facet _wrap(bmicat ~ no2dec, nrow = 2, ncol =4)
  '+' geom _smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE, col="steelblue") #se=FALSE removes the confidence interval band
  '+' theme _bw(base _family = "Avenir", base _size = 10) #Helvetica size 12 is default
  '+' labs(x = expression("log " * PM[2.5])  #the boxed 2.5 subsets the number in the label
  '+' labs(y = "Nocturnal Symptoms")
  '+' labs(title = "MAACS Cohort")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can easily save the above into an object, and then add more layers if you wanted to </p>
