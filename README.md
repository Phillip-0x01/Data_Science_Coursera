# Johns Hopkins Data Science Certification Class Materials
This is a collection of all the documents I collected and/or developed while completing the Johns Hopkins Data Science Certification Program on Coursea.  

This was also my first experience with GitHub and at one point while trying to reorganize all of the repositories into one master repository I mistakenly deleted all of the materials I collected/developed in a couple of the courses.  At some point I may go back and retake those courses just to rebuild that material.
